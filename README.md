+ Removed Input Boost, which locked the CPU at 1267 every time you had the SPEN out. Now you can use CPU boost instead. I recommend at least 652 MHz for 800 ms to prevent lag when you do touch the screen.

20161108
+ Starting over because old kernel had random reboot issue. This kernel does not have the random reboots, the goal is to keep it that way.
